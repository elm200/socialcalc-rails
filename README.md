# Socialcalc-rails gem

[SocialCalc](https://github.com/marcelklehr/socialcalc) is a great JavaScript-based spreadsheet working on web browsers. However, it is a bit difficult to use it with Ruby on Rails applications because there is little information on it. Therefore, I have created a gem that allows you to use SocialCalc spreadsheets on Ruby on Rails application with ease.

## Usage
See a sample Rails application at https://github.com/elm200/socialcalc-rails-sample.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'socialcalc-rails'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install socialcalc-rails
```
## Generators

```bash
$ rails g socialcalc:images
```
This command lets you to have SocialCalc related images installed under public/sc\_images/.

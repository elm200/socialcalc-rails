# Socialcalc::Rails

SocialCalc is a great JavaScript-based spreadsheet working on web browsers. However, it was a bit difficult to use it with Ruby on Rails applications because there is little information on it. Therefore, I created a gem that allows you to use SocialCalc spreadsheets on Ruby on Rails application with ease.

## Usage
See a sample Rails application at https://github.com/elm200/socialcalc-rails-sample.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'socialcalc-rails'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install socialcalc-rails
```

## Contributing
